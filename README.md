<span style="font-weight: 400;">DNA is a helical pattern protein molecule found inside the human body that can tell you about many characteristics of the human body. One can consider the DNA as a hard drive that has all the information stored inside it. With the help of DNA studies, scientists can hack into the system and take information that is stored inside the DNA. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">DNA is also known as ribonucleic acid because it is made up of smaller building units known as nucleotides, and these units are arranged in a specific manner in every human being, which makes every human unique from the others. It is noted that the DNA of two people can never be the same except if the two individuals are identical twins.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> In this article, we'll learn about how we can do a DNA test without anyone knowing about it, as it is the most googled question because people are always concerned about the privacy of the test. More questions are often asked by people, like can we do a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">DNA test by photo</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or is there any free DNA testing for father and child only?

<b>Facts about DNA: </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> We already know DNA can't be the same for any two human beings. Why can’t it be the same? Well, the answer is that people get their DNA from the mixing of the parent's DNA, that is, the mother and the father. Proper mixing of the DNA gives rise to a unique DNA. Moreover, specific biological markers are found by the scientists working on the DNA that help them locate genes for different characteristics, and it helps them get to the result for which they are running the test. By knowing </span><a href="https://www.choicedna.com/12-interesting-fun-facts-about-dna/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">facts about DNA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it is possible to conduct a successful DNA test. </span>

<b>DNA Tests and Privacy:</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Privacy could be attained for DNA tests through the following measures.</span>

<b> 1-Choosing your service wisely:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> DNA tests can be performed privately without anyone knowing. You must ask the service you choose about their privacy policy and go through it. If the privacy plan says that the test will be done in complete privacy and no one can know about the test without your permission, that is a green flag. Most companies working for DNA testing provide complete privacy to the patients. As these tests could be performed for sensitive issues, it is good to ensure privacy first.</span>

These tests can be achieved by getting a kit from your medical supplier or the company you want your test performed by and then easily done at home by following specific steps and taking some precautions. Samples like cheek swabs, hair samples, saliva samples, or blood samples are often required for the test and can be taken at home very easily, too.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Conducting a DNA Test At Home:</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> The steps for doing a DNA test at home are discussed below:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">1- Order a DNA test kit.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">2- Open the kit and try not to contaminate it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">3- Take the swab from the kit and take the sample as instructed in the instruction manual.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">4-Put the sample back in the kit.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">5-Make sure you don't contaminate the sample with anything, as this can lead to result errors.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">6-Fill the relevant information, return it to the lab, and get the results online.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>3-Face DNA testing:</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">People can perform face DNA testing through different types of applications on mobile phones. The results generated by the apps are accurate most of the time. You can have a lot of information through these apps, like ancestral information or to which parent your facial features match more. You can have information about how you are going to look when you get old or how your facial features would be if you were a girl. They can also tell about potential family relationships. However, the results can sometimes be non-definitive compared to a DNA test performed at a laboratory.</span>

&nbsp;
